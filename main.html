        <p>
          In this game you play as Dan, Ramona, or Lana. Your goal is to look
          for your pet Bean! You woke up and have no clue where he went. As you
          walk around your town you will be able to interact with your
          environment, and find clues to lead you to bean. The only rules are to
          have fun, and the only tip is to make sure you read the prompts when
          interacting with your environment!
