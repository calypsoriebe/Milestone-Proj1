## Inspo and how to play

I originally found my inspiration for my game in some of my favorite games, pokemon and stardew valley.\
 I knew I wanted to make a pixelated simple game, and I wanted to be able to maybe catch pokemon or do something around a cute village (like in stardew). In the end I came up with my _Tomo-mon_ adventure game!\
 The point of this game is for you to walk around the neighborhood following clues to help you find new cute friends!
