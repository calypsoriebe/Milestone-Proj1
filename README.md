The repo for my first milestone project!

## Inspo and how to play
I was inspired by my favorites games (pokemon) to make a pixelated web browser game.
The game will start with you picking your starting _tomo-mon_, and picking your character.
From there you will walk around the wild and find encounters. 
Once in an encounter you will battle other _tomo-mons_.
The goal is to fight as many as you can before getting knocked out. 
Everytime you win a battle your stats will go up a little, and after and x amount of wins you should get healed.

WASD for movement
You can click on any buttons or prompts on the page
Those should be all the controls for now :)
very simple! Enjoy!
